    anaconda (py interpreter with scipy matplotlib)
        -> installed in /home/paolo/.anaconda3
        -> scipy, matplotlip, pip
    changed backend keras to theano in /home/.keras/keras.json
    learned how to import csv
    plt.imshow(np.reshape(newdata[1],[28,28])), plt.show()
    Flatten() layer if outputs dont match labels
    train-test split
    0.958 accuracy 1 epoch (but 0.92 on training)
    the reshape is useless but lets me see the images

    found mistake! for theano, keras.json->image_data_format is channels_first,
    while for tensorflow it should be channels_last! maybe that's why yesterday
    was having problems? will test. 
    turns out, i did make a mistake but the problem wasn't due to that. fixed now
    0.974 accuracy 1 epoch
    learned convolution and pooling (pooling is kinda trash, but understand)
    started watching 6.S191
